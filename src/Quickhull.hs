-- This algorithm will use a head-flags array to distinguish the different
-- sections of the hull (the two arrays are always the same length).
--
-- A flag value of 'True' indicates that the corresponding point is
-- definitely on the convex hull. The points after the 'True' flag until
-- the next 'True' flag correspond to the points in the same segment, and
-- where the algorithm has not yet decided whether or not those points are
-- on the convex hull.

-- Core implementation
-- -------------------

-- Initialise the algorithm by first partitioning the array into two
-- segments. Locate the left-most (p₁) and right-most (p₂) points. The
-- segment descriptor then consists of the point p₁, followed by all the
-- points above the line (p₁,p₂), followed by the point p₂, and finally all
-- of the points below the line (p₁,p₂).
--
-- To make the rest of the algorithm a bit easier, the point p₁ is again
-- placed at the end of the array.
--
-- We indicate some intermediate values that you might find beneficial to
-- compute.
